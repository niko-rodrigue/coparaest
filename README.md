Prerequisites:

1. COPASI installed on the cluster (or COPASI module loaded)
2. bash and perl installed on the cluster (should be by default)

Workflow:

1. Prepare your COPASI model file (see example in the model folder):
 * Setup Parameter Estimation task with the default Report
 * The Parameter Estimation Report file must be named 'param-est-report.txt'

2. Copy your ".cps" file in the 'model' directory (don't forget to remove all example files from it) together with experimental data file
3. From root directory run:

```bash
sh run.sh n c
```

where n is number of parameter estimations (must be > 10) and c is your cluster queuing system ('sge' or 'lsf'). This will start n jobs on your cluster. All output will appear in 'results' folder

4. Wait until all jobs are finished and then run:

```bash
perl get-obj-values.pl
```

This will summarize all estimation objectives values in 'results/obj-values.txt'. This file contains indecies of parameter estimations (first column) sorted by their objective values (second column) with the best estimation in the first row. Then you can pick up top 10 indecies and look at the parameters in the 'results/param-estimations' folder. Go in the folder with the selected index and look at the 'estd-params.txt'. This file will contain all values of estimated parameters.
